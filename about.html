          <h6>Full-time student</h6>
          <p>
            Full stack coding boot camp in Manchester teaching a practical,
            industry-led curriculum. All code was TDD and utilized version
            control (Git) and pair programming throughout. During my time on the
            course I was able to build upon my previous knowledge of HTML, CSS
            Bootstrap, React, @Reach router, and DOM manipulation to gain a new
            level of effectiveness with these tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to these front end skills I gained a deep understanding
            of Node, Express, Knex, and SQL. Utilizing these skills I was able
            to build a social media distribution site from end to end, fully
            tested with Mocha Chai Cypress and aXe.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the final 2 weeks we created a React native treasure hunt app
            for kids in an agile environment. From conception to completion we
            were able to manage the heavy workload by adhering to core agile
            practices such as daily stand ups, allocating tasks based on user
            stories, and organizing the workload with githubs “projects” kanban
            board.
